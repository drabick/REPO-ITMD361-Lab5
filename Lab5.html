    Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period around the Sun of 88 days is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System.
    It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.
    </p>
  
    <p id="jup1">
    Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar
    System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity.
    </p>
    
    <p id="sat1">
    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.
    It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive.Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol represents the god's sickle.
    </p>
    
    <p id="nep1">
    Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
    Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.
